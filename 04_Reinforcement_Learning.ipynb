    "### 4.3. Actor Loss \n",
    "The actor loss is defined to maximize the policy performance. Since the Actor has to decide an action, this is a categorical classification problem, where there is just one good action to be applied, the best choice. For that reason, we have used a softmax activation function. Then, the loss function for this is the categorical cross-entropy. However, we have no ground truth, since we have no direct access to the real better action. Then, the critic is a workaround to be able to compute a \"ground truth\" for the cathegorical cross-entropy, the Advantage. Because, by minimizing the negative log-probability of selected actions weighted by the advantage, we will train the Actor to get better than the critic. Therefore, the Advantage is calculated as:\n",
